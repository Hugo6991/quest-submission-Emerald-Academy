## Chapter 1 Day 1

1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words:

Blockchain is a kind of special database to allow anyone could add info or join this network to be a node and maintain the network. Every single block stored transaction, you can see a block as a page of ledge. If we connect all the block that will become a completed ledge, and we call this “distributed ledger”

2. Explain what a Smart Contract is: Smart Contract

Smart contract is like an operation system, allow programmer to create their application base on the logic. You have to use the language that computer ( blockchain ) could understand to tell them how should work. Then you create am application allow users to interact with app. 

3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction

transaction is a key paid function in blockchain. It could **CHANGE** data on blockchain like if you move a NFT token from A to B. That’s a transaction about transfer. 

a script is used to **VIEW** data on the Blockchain, they do not change it. Scripts do not cost any money, that'd be ridiculous.


## Chapter 1 Day 2

1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

- **Safety and Security — 安全與保障**
- **Clarity — 清楚易懂的程式語言**
- **Approachability — 容易上手 撰寫方式和其他開發語言行向**
- **Developer Experience** - 開發體驗。讓糾錯變得易懂、簡單，因為 error messages 顯示很清楚
- Resource Oriented Programming - 新範式「 資源導向 」 接下來會有更多課程介紹


2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful:

Safety is the most important things on this digital world. The increase of security definitely will convince more users who are not trust new tech. 

Clarity will allow us to understand how this function really work. That reduce the barrier about export, people could be more creative and use those easily words to build whole new scenario. 

**Approachability reduce the barrier for new builder and developer, even for those who haven’t experience.** 

**Developer Experience improve and accelerate debug workflow and make whole process more efficient,**
