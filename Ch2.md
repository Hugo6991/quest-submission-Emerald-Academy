## ****Quests****

1. Deploy a contract to account `0x03` called "JacobTucker". Inside that contract, declare a **constant** variable named `is`, and make it have type `String`. Initialize it to "the best" when your contract gets deployed.

3. Check that your variable `is` actually equals "the best" by executing a script to read that variable. Include a screenshot of the output.
